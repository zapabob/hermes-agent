"""Rotation-stable logical cache scope for prompt_cache_key derivation.

Context-compression rotation (legacy ``compression.in_place: false`` mode)
mints a new physical ``session_id`` mid-conversation to segment the
transcript. The prompt-cache scope introduced by #79161 was derived from that
physical id, so every rotation moved the conversation into a fresh cache
bucket even though it is logically the same conversation continuing
(issue #79017).

``resolve_prompt_cache_scope()`` maps the physical session id to the ROOT of
its *compression lineage* — the pre-rotation session id — using
``SessionDB.get_compression_lineage()``, whose fork-aware semantics
(hardened in #79193) give exactly the scope boundaries the cache key needs.
NOT ``SessionDB.get_conversation_root`` / ``run_agent._conversation_root_id``
(the Portal-attribution walk): that one follows ``parent_session_id`` blindly,
collapsing /branch children and whole delegate trees into one id, which would
violate the #79161 isolation this scope must preserve. The two resolvers are
intentionally different — do not "deduplicate" them.

- compression-rotation children walk back to the original segment
  (rotation-stable scope — the fix);
- ``/new`` starts a lineage-less session (fresh scope);
- ``/branch`` children (``_branched_from``), delegate subagents
  (``_delegate_from``), and tool-tagged children (``source="tool"``) are
  explicit fork children and keep their own isolated scope, preserving the
  sibling/subagent isolation #79161 established;
- cron fires keep their physical ``cron_<job>_<ts>`` id here — the per-fire
  timestamp is stripped later by ``_cache_scope_from_session_id`` exactly as
  before.

A host that mints one physical ``session_id`` per RESPONSE (Hermes Studio's
group chat, and ``POST /v1/responses`` with client-managed history, which
mints ``str(uuid4())`` per request) re-keys every conversation-affinity hint
Hermes sends — ``prompt_cache_key`` on both OpenAI-wire transports, plus the
OpenRouter/Nous sticky ``session_id`` and xAI's ``x-grok-conv-id`` through
``portal_tags`` (issue #96811). Those rows carry no lineage, so the walk
above correctly returns the physical id and the scope moves every reply.

Hermes must not infer the logical conversation from the id's SYNTAX (that
rule collides independent client-supplied ids and merges Studio members
truncated past its 96-character boundary — the #79017 failure class). The
host has to declare it, and one carrier already means exactly that:
``gateway_session_key`` — the "stable per-chat key" (``agent:main:telegram:
dm:123``) built by ``gateway.session.build_session_key`` from the
``X-Hermes-Session-Key`` header, which branching deliberately does NOT key
off. ``declared_conversation_scope()`` consumes it, and it wins over the
lineage walk because it is stable across rotation AND across per-response
ids. Two boundaries it must not cross:

- explicit fork children (``/branch``, delegate subagents, tool children)
  share their parent's chat key but are separate conversations — the row's
  fork markers keep them on their own scope (#79161);
- background-review forks run on a clone of the live runtime, so they are
  excluded by ``_persist_disabled`` for the same reason.

The declared key is hashed into ``gwk_<sha256[:24]>`` before it becomes a
scope: unlike a session id it embeds platform/chat/user identifiers, and
this value leaves the process verbatim as OpenRouter's sticky ``session_id``
and xAI's ``x-grok-conv-id``.

The resolution is memoized per (agent, session_id): the lineage walk runs
once per transcript segment — NOT per API call — and re-runs only when
rotation actually changes ``agent.session_id`` (per the no-DB-on-the-hot-path
constraint recorded on #79017). Default installs compact in place and never
rotate, so they hit the memo forever and behave byte-identically to before.
